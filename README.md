## Data Sets
- Average life expectancy for residents of every state
- compared to other factors such as...
  - GDP per capita
  - State Health Spending Per Capita 
  - Obama Approval Rating 
  - State Unemployment Rate 
  - State Wellbeing Index 
  - etc...

## Relevance/Significance
The multiple scatterplots will show the relationships between life expectancy in states across the US and factors that we believe can influence life expectancy, such as GDP per capita, unemployment, average alcohol consumption, etc. Comparing these  sets of data to life expectancy can show us trends and help us generalize the effects of a certain aspects that can influence its life expectancy.

## Data Visualization
We will create a scatterplot with the y-axis being the average life expectancy. The x-axis will vary between different factors that the user will be able to choose from. After choosing the x-axis, we will use D3 to plot the points on the scatterplot and create a line of best fit. In addition, we will calculate the linear regression in order to figure out the correlation between the graphs. By hovering over each point on the scatterplot, the user will be show that point's state, GDP, and whatever other factor is being compared. Given enough time, we may also incorperate time into this and include a scroll bar that takes you through years of data showing the growth of life expectancy and other factors over time.

## Use of D3

We will use D3 in order to accomplish many tasks such as...
