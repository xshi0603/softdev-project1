## Relevance/Significance
The scatterplot will show the relationship between GDP and serveral other factors. Using our graphs, you will be able to see what affects GDP and what doesn't.

## Data Visualization
We will create a scatterplot with the y-axis being the GDP. The x-axis will vary between different factors that the user will be able to choose from. After choosing your x-axis, we will use D3 to plot the points on the scatterplot and create a line of best fit. In addition, we will calculate the linear regression in order to figure out the correlation between the graphs. By hovering over each point on the scatterplot, the user will be show that point's state, GDP, and whatever other factor is being compared. Given enough time, we may also incorperate time into this and include a scroll bar that takes you through years.
